### Review of the literature
The term Rashomon effect was created to describe a situation when there are many different models with quite similar predictions. Very often there are many different descriptions giving about the same minimum error rate, so that we cannot point one model as the best @6-0-breiman2001statistical. As an example of this effect in reality they gave Linear Regression model and finding 5 from 30 best describing variables of a given problem. In this case there are approximately 140,000 such subsets. The authors explained that usually we choose the model which has best results on a test set, although there may be also different subsets of 5 variables that give very similar results. They also noticed that this effect occurs in different models, such as decision trees or neural networks.  

Furthermore, @6-0-rashomon-intro contributed to expand the study about Rashomon effect. They defined Rashomon set as a subset of models that have similar performance to the best model in terms of loss function. Moreover they introduced Rashomon ratio, that represents the fraction of models that fit our data equally well. Also they explained that Rashomon curve is a function of empirical risk versus the Rashomon ratio. They saw that there is a good generalization of the Rashomon curve’s elbow model when choosing between performance and simplicity of the model. They found out that interpretability of model is connected with Rashomon sets. Accordingly, when the Rashomon set is large there may exist simpler and higher performing model.  

Analysis of the Rashomon effect is still a new and open for developement field of the interpretable machine learning. Because of that, there are remaining challanges and problems, which are missing a state-of-the-art approach. Some of them are a proper measure of the Rashomon set, the best techniques of its visualization and optimal choice of the model from the Rashomon set @6-0-rudin-challenges. One of useful tools for the mentioned tasks is a framework called Variable Importance Clouds @6-0-rashomon-variable-importance-cloud, which can be used for studying the variable importance among Rashomon set.

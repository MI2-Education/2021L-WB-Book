### Introduction and motivation

Interest in explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has increased significantly in recent years. XAI facilitates humans to understand artificial intelligence (AI) solutions [@2-3-xai]. It contrasts with the concept of a black box where even its designers cannot explain why an AI model has arrived at a specific conclusion. The intense development of such methods has led to a wide choice of XAI tools that we have today [@2-3-landscape]. It includes the R package DALEX [@2-3-dalex], which is the foundation of this work.

Our goal is to prepare and explain a model designed to predict the probability of subsequent blood donations based on a history of a patient's previous offerings. Careful use of XAI tools allows us to verify model correctness and discover phenomenons affecting blood donations that hide in the data. Obtained knowledge may have various implications, including improvement of planning and advertising of blood donation campaigns.

### Data and model

#### Original dataset

The data which all the prepared models are based upon comes from the Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set, which is available through OpenML website [@2-3-openml].

The dataset consists of 748 observations (representing individual patients) described by 5 attributes:

  * recency - months since last blood donation,
  * frequency - total number of blood donations,
  * monetary - total amount of donated blood in c.c.,
  * time - months since first blood donation,
  * donated - a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007.

#### Data analysis

Initial data analysis is a critical process allowing to discover patterns and check assumptions about the data. It is performed with the help of summary statistics and graphical data representations. 

The short data analysis below is based on two visualizations representing distributions and correlations of variables.

```{r 2-3-distributions, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Distributions of explanatory variables (histogram).'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-distributions.png')
```

Based on the above figure \@ref(fig:2-3-distributions) an important insight can be made - distributions of Frequency and Monetary variables are identical (excluding support). It probably comes from the fact that during every donation the same amount of blood is drawn. The presence of both of these variables in the final model is pointless.

```{r 2-3-correlations, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Correlations of explanatory variables (correlation matrix).'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-correlations.png')
```

The above figure \@ref(fig:2-3-correlations) represents correlations of explanatory variables measured using robust Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Apart from the already clear perfect correlation of Monetary and Frequency variables, a strong correlation of Time and Monetary/Frequency variables is visible. It probably comes from the fact that the minimal interval between subsequent donations is strictly controlled. Such dependence can negatively affect model performance and explanations. This potential problem is addressed during pre-processing of used data.

#### Pre-processing

Simple data pre-processing is conducted, mainly to reduce detected correlations of explanatory variables.

Firstly, the variable Monetary is removed from the dataset. The information it carries duplicates information contained in the Frequency variable.

Secondly, a derived variable is introduced instead of Time variable. It is called Intensity and is calculated as follows:

$$\textrm{Intensity} = \frac{\textrm{Frequency}}{\textrm{Time}-\textrm{Recency}}$$

The above equation results in values from range $[0.03125, 1.00000]$.

The denominator can be interpreted as a time window bounding all the known donations of a given patient.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of the new variable Intensity and the old variable Frequency is $-0.46$, which is lower compared to the previous $0.72$ value for the Time / Frequency combination.

#### Final model

According to the OpenML website Ranger implementation of Random Forests [@2-3-ranger] is among the best performing classifiers for the considered task. All the tested models utilize this ML algorithm.

Performance of the models is assessed through three measures - basic classification accuracy and more complex areas under the ROC [@2-3-roc-1] [@2-3-roc-2] / PR [@2-3-pr-1] [@2-3-pr-2] curves. The area under the PR curve is an especially adequate measure for unbalanced classification problems [@2-3-pr-3], which is the case here.

Based on the described measures, the best model is chosen from models trained on the following explanatory variables subsets:

* Recency, Time
* Recency, Frequency,
* Recency, Frequency, Time
* Recency, Frequency, Intensity

Models utilizing only two explanatory variables perform significantly worse. Out of the last two models, the model utilizing the Time variable is slightly worse than the model utilizing the Intensity variable.

The accuracy of the last model is $0.85$, other performance measures describing it are presented graphically below.

```{r 2-3-roc, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='ROC curve and corresponding AUC for final model.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-roc.png')
```

ROC curve visible in the above figure \@ref(fig:2-3-roc) represents good model performance and AUC value of almost $0.92$ is definitely satisfactory.

```{r 2-3-pr, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='PR curve and corresponding AUC for final model.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-pr.png')
```

The baseline for the ROC AUC is always $0.5$, but it is not the case for the PR AUC. Here, the baseline AUC is equal to the proportion of positive observations in the data. In our case it is $\frac{178}{748}=0.238$. Due to the above, the PR AUC value of around $0.81$ visible in the figure \@ref(fig:2-3-pr) is also proof of high model precision.

Summarizing the above model selection, the final model used in all the presented explanations is Ranger implementation of Random Forests utilizing the Recency, Frequency, and Intensity variables. Its performance measures are at least good, so the prepared explanations have a chance to be accurate.

### Global explanations

Global explanations are used to discover how individual variables affect average model prediction on the level of the whole dataset. Here, we can learn how strong is the influence of a given variable or how its particular values shape the overall model response.

In the case of large numbers of observations, global explanations can be prepared using only a fraction of them to save calculations time. Dataset presented in this work can be considered small, and therefore all observations are always used.

#### Permutation Feature Importance

Permutation Feature Importance [@2-3-pfi] is a method of assessing how strongly given variable affects the overall model prediction. The idea behind it is to measure change in model's performance when it is not allowed to utilize selected feature. Removal of variables from the model is realized through multiple random permutations of it.

```{r 2-3-permutation, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Permutation Feature Importance for final model.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-permutation.png')
```

Figure \@ref(fig:2-3-permutation) shows, all explanatory variables have significant importance in the model under study. The most important feature is Recency (highest loss after permutation) followed by derived variable Intensity and Frequency in the last.

The significance of the Recency variable is well visible later on, especially when local explanations are considered.

#### Partial Dependence Profile

Partial Dependence Profile [@2-3-pdp-1] [@2-3-pdp-2] allows users to see how the expected model prediction behaves as a function of a given variable. It is realized through averaging (basic arithmetic mean) of multiple Ceteris-Paribus Profiles, a method described in the Local Explanations section.

```{r 2-3-pdp, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Partial Dependence Profile for final model.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-pdp.png')
```

Firstly, curves presented in the figure above \@ref(fig:2-3-pdp) are visibly ragged. This is mostly caused by the selection of the ML algorithm - Random Forests contain many if-then rules that can change the final prediction value rapidly, even with small explanatory variable change. Therefore, it is best to look at the overall shape of yielded curves and ignore the uneven details.

Visible shapes are mostly in line with intuition - higher Frequency and Intensity values yield higher prediction (probability of subsequent blood donation to recall), whereas the impact of Recency is inverse - the lower the value the higher the prediction.

However, some parts of the curves need further investigation - the tails. For the Frequency variable, the profile tail simply flattens, whereas for the other two variables there is a significant change in the mean prediction value.

The explanation of the strange Frequency / Recency curves is simple - an insufficient amount of data. There are only eight observations with $\textrm{Frequency} > 30$ and only nine observations with $\textrm{Recency} > 24$. It is a worthy remainder that XAI methods can be only as good as the data and the model itself.

Interestingly enough, the case of the sudden drop in mean prediction as a function of the Intensity variable value is much different. It is a genuine pattern contained in the data itself, that the model has learned to take advantage of. The following table aids greatly in interpreting these results:

|                                  | Observations with Intensity > 0.55 (group A) | Observations with Intensity < 0.55 (group B) |
|:--------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|
| **Total number of observations** |                      241                     |                      507                     |
|   **Number of positive cases**   |                      42                      |                      136                     |

In group A there is $17\%$ of positive observations, and in group B there is $27\%$. Using Fisher's exact test [@2-3-fisher] it can be shown that the difference in proportions between mentioned groups is statistically significant (p-value $0.0028$).

The probable hypothesis is that above a certain Intensity threshold there is an increased chance of patients burnout caused by too frequent donations.

#### Accumulated Local Effect Profile

The method presented in the previous subsection - Partial Dependence Profile, can be misleading if explanatory variables are strongly correlated, which to some extent is still the case here, even after pre-processing. Accumulated Local Effect Profile [@2-3-ale] is another method for explaining a variable's effect on prediction, that is designed to address mentioned issue.

```{r 2-3-ale, out.width='600', fig.align='center', echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Accumulated Local Effect Profile for final model.'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/2-3-ale.png')
```

Although this method addresses the very problem the used data has, no significant difference is visible in the figure \@ref(fig:2-3-ale) when compared to the previous figure \@ref(fig:2-3-pdp). This only reassures that the conclusions presented in the previous subsection are correct.
